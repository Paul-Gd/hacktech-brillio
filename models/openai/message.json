            "review_text": "I love my phone. It came brand new! It's unlocked and works with my carrier (Visible & Verizon and probably many more). The only thing I wish it had is emergency satellite commection like the iphone. I live in FL with hurricanes so that's important. I absolutely love my camera capabilities. It blows away any other phones. Everyone is amazed by the way the photos look. Unfortunately now all my friends make me take pics when we are out together. The phone has a very big screen which is nice for watching videos and playing games. It charges fast wirelessly or usb c. I read it even can charge other people's phones! Battery lasts all day when I charge it at night and use it all day long with a million apps open.",

            "review_text": "The best 1,100 dollars I've spent this year. I went from a note 10 plus to two 2 S22 Ultras which were sold as excellent condition which were not and tried twice 2 phones on here and they came In terrible condition so I shipped them back and decided to buy a new S 24 Ultra . I love this phone. It came packaged well. It came with a charger but not a wall port. That's fine with me. I'm still learning the new features on this phone being that it has so many awesome features and also I read that this phone is rated better than the I phone 15 pro max . Sound quality is great. The battery last a very long time. I took this off of the charger at 8am. I had a movie playing . I took phone calls and texts and it's now 11.5 hours later and it's at 50% . 10 stars just for that !! Also I placed a glass cover over the screen and lens and redid my finger print and you'd never know that I had something that thick on my screen. It reads my print quickly.\nThis phone also takes wonderful pictures. You can also remove shadows or add object or people from pics from previous phones or the one that was taken from this phone . Pretty cool. Overall this has been thee best phone . I'm so glad that I didn't settle for the 22 ultra. Going to update soon with some pics",

            "review_text": "When a phone costs $1000 it better be special. I have had Samsung galaxies or my last 2 phones, and I'm sold. However a grand for a phone is too steep. So, I waited for a sale and purchased unlocked for $750.\n\nStill pricey, but it is worth it. It has a fast processor. The battery lasts 16 hours or more, at the end of the day I typically have 40% charge remaining.\n\nIwas worried about having enough storage, without an external micro disc slot, but I've added more apps than I have ever had, and I download a number of streaming shows for offline viewing and still have plenty of space left. 12 gb RAM is also nice, I usually have 6 to 7 gb free at any given time.\n\nOverall my fastest and most favorite phone yet.",

            "review_text": "I had a s20FE which was a very good phone at a great price. After 4 yrs the battery would drain often so I decided to trade it in. Amazon had an amazing deal on the s24 256g and based an positive reviews I grabbed it. Very easy to setup and transfer data using Samsung smart switch. I wanted a Samsung, a smaller phone with good battery life. I did not want to pay a premium price. Phone is perfect size and very light. Beautiful screen inside and outdoors. Very fast processor. I set charge to 80% max and get battery life all day and into next morning, and I normally still have 20% when I recharge. I've had over a month and have had no issues. I believe all the bugs were ironed out by the time I bought it. I have zero regrets and if you can get a deal on, I highly recommend. I'm not a big camera buff so can't comment too much on it, but the picture quality looks great.",

            "review_text": "PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!\n\nBy looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.\nNext about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.\nIt has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!\nThe sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.\nI still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.\nThe OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).\nThe battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.\nThe only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.\nI started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.\nOverall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.",
