- [ ] idea: from Roli - use gpt-4o-mini with some prompts. Maybe we can also use this to extract the product description & data from page
- [ ] todo: summary from reviews 
- [ ] todo: add rating value and URL and model certainty to the api
- [ ] todo: add a new rating score based on the review. Maybe we can give it all the reviews
- [ ] maybe todo: create testing endpoint just for one review
- [ ] issues: prompt injection, prompt length
- [ ] issue/improvement: retail websites such as Amazon and emag do not allow chatgpt to read the page details. We can download it, but we need to make sure that the page was rendered and that the reviews are visible
- [ ] improvement: datasets for trainijg: https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/ 
- [ ] improvement: app streaming
- [ ] improvement: text to speech the summary
- [ ] improvement: add images
- [ ] create problem statement: reading reviews is hard and time consuming/people rate things differently based on their expectation /there are fake reviews that try to manipulate the user
- [ ] openai: maybe use moderation
- [ ] openai: use prompt engineering like this https://chatgpt.com/share/671c699d-2720-8003-8d6a-3e4bf7cc7529 
- [ ] openai: how to create prompts https://chatgpt.com/share/671c69e6-2dfc-8003-a829-1b6b64229a97
- [ ] openai: prompt to label the review as: helpful, fake, not helpful
- [ ] openai: use chat response format json and seed for repeatable results https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-seed 
- [ ] extension: use custom icon
- [ ] reviews: search for fake reviews on amazon
